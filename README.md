## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Asha Ross, and I am an anthropologist turned web developer. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two fun projects. 
These are:
- SURVIVAL. This is a storytelling game focused on preparedness for natural disasters, (but gameified!). It is structured as a story that allows the player to make choices that determine how well they can survive a natural disaster, which strikes at a random time in the game and puts the player's skills and preparendess to the test!
- Trope Trove (previously Book Bites). This is a literature recommendation app, designed for people who love to read. What makes it different? The recommendations are based on tropes and essential qualities of literature that you love, not on genre or storyline. Love the enemies-to-lovers trope, or the villain with a secret heart of gold? Find other pieces of literature across genre and style to widen your reading lists. Future feature currently in development: Books For This Feel. This will add in the ability to search for recommendations based on how the book has impacted others. Love a story that offends, amuses, inspires, or horrifies? You can search for literature based on what you want to feel while reading it. Watch this space!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to contextualise my own approach to problem-solving in a tech space! I am also constantly looking for new technology to explore and how to best utilise it. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to find others who are passionate about technology, storytelling, and problem-solving. I love to work in a team, and would love to approach a project with other perspectives in the mix. 

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building my skillset in tech, as I am in the process of growing my technical skills. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the crossover between anthropology and tech -- there's more than you might think! 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: I am on X (formerly Twitter) and have a link here on Github -- feel free to reach out!

âš¡ Fun fact: For my PhD in anthropology, I spent three years learning parkour!
